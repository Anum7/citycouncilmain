            Our city faces infrastructure challenges: water, power grid, and traffic to and from our city. <br>
            With my vast understanding and knowledge of city zoning. <br>
             I will engage with State Legislators and ABAG to educate them on Foster City's infrastructure limitations, and how the mandates do not work in Foster City. </p>

            </p><strong>Structural Deficit</strong><br>Foster City is projecting a financial deficit in the next few years. Our city will need to overcome inflation, rising interest rates to make ends meet.<br>

             In the past, Foster City has taken proactive steps for a "soft landing", with reserves. Our Council needs to investigate new revenue opportunities and explore operational efficiencies.<div class="prioritystructure"></div></p>
