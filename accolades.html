        <P> <h3> Recognition by Congresswoman Jackie Speier </h3>
          Upon retiring from the City Council in 2015, 
               Congresswoman Jackie Speier presented to me 
               a plaque noting that my name and accomplishments 
               were recorded the U.S. House of Representatives 
               Congressional Record. </P>      
         <P>  The last Paragraph of the 
               Recognition states the following: </P>      
         <P>"Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives 
               to rise with me to honor a great man, public servant 
               and good friend. Art Kiesel stands for integrity, 
               commitment, and perseverance. He will be missed 
               in Foster City's public life, but his contributions 
               will make Foster City a stronger and more vibrant 
               community for decades to come." </P>

               Resolution from the State Legislature from Assembly 
               Member Kevin Mullin and State Senator Jerry Hill, 
               presented in December, 2015.</P>      
       
             <h3>  The last Paragraph of the 
               Resolution states the following: </h3>
             
               <P>
               "Resolved by Assembly Member Kevin Mullin and Senator Jerry Hill, 
               That they take personal pleasure in commending the Honorable Art 
               Kiesel upon the occasion of his retirement as a member of the 
               Foster City City Council and Mayor of the City of Foster City, 
               for his admirable record of responsible citizenship and dedicated 
               service, and for enhancing the lives of the people of Foster City, 
               and convey their warm best wishes for further achievement and

                     Closing paragraph: <br> 
                     
                    "During his last meeting, former councilwoman and former 
                     Mayor Linda Koelling said that Kiesel will be remembered 
                     for his “integrity, professionalism, honesty, humbleness, 
                     selflessness, and being honorable.” We could not agree more. 
                     Kiesel was always willing to talk to all sides in a dispute 
                     and was consistently well prepared for every meeting. When 
                     he disagreed with others, he did it in a professional manner 
                     and was respectful to everyone who spoke before the Council. 
                     We are sorry to see Art leave office and wish him well in 
                     his future endeavours." 
               </P>
